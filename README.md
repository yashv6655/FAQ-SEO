# FAQ SEO Builder

> AI-powered SEO FAQ generation tool designed for developer-focused companies to improve search visibility and user engagement.

## Overview

FAQBuilder is a full-stack web application that generates SEO-optimized FAQ content with structured data (JSON-LD schema) for better search engine visibility. Built specifically for Sita's ICP of developer-tool companies seeking to improve their content strategy and organic search performance.

## Architecture Requirements Addressed

### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- **Extract**: User input collection via form interfaces
- **Transform**: AI-powered content generation using Anthropic Claude API
- **Load**: Persistent storage in Supabase PostgreSQL with structured data models

### Full-Stack Implementation
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React Server Components and TypeScript
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with server-side authentication
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with middleware-based route protection

### Internet Deployment Ready
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 optimized for Vercel deployment
- **Database**: Cloud-hosted Supabase instance
- **Environment**: Production-ready with environment variable configuration
- **Build**: TypeScript compilation with optimized bundle size

### Database Integration
- **Primary DB**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **Schema**: Normalized tables for projects, generations, and FAQ items
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data isolation
- **Performance**: Indexed queries and optimized data relationships

### Security Implementation
- **Authentication**: JWT-based session management via Supabase
- **Authorization**: User-scoped data access with RLS policies
- **Route Protection**: Middleware-based authentication checks
- **Data Validation**: Zod schema validation on API endpoints
- **Environment Security**: Secure API key management

### Sita ICP Alignment
**Target Audience**: Developer-tool companies and technical decision makers
**Value Proposition**: 
- Improves organic search visibility for technical products
- Reduces content creation overhead for developer relations teams
- Generates schema.org structured data for rich search results
- Provides analytics insights for content performance optimization

### Beautiful Design
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with Radix UI components
- **Design System**: Consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with adaptive layouts
- **UX**: Intuitive form flows with real-time validation and feedback

### Analytics Enabled

**Platform**: PostHog for comprehensive behavioral analytics and product optimization

**Detailed Event Tracking**:

*Landing Page Analytics*:
- `landing_cta_clicked` - Tracks CTA interactions (start_building, view_example)
- `feature_viewed` - Monitors which features generate the most interest
- `example_interaction` - Tracks FAQ example engagement (viewed, expanded)

*Authentication Flow*:
- `auth_attempt` - Login/register attempts with method tracking
- `auth_success` - Successful authentication events
- `auth_error` - Authentication failures with error context

*FAQ Generation Funnel*:
- `faq_form_field_completed` - Field-by-field completion tracking
- `faq_tab_switched` - User interaction with results tabs (preview, jsonld, export)
- `faq_exported` - Export type preferences (json, markdown, jsonld_script)
- `faq_copied` - Copy-to-clipboard usage (markdown, jsonld)

*User Engagement*:
- `dashboard_action` - Dashboard usage patterns (viewed_history, deleted_faq, regenerated)
- `performance_metric` - API response times and generation latency
- `$pageview` - Page navigation tracking with custom page names

**Rate Limiting**: 1-second rate limiting per event type to prevent quota exhaustion while maintaining data quality

**Privacy**: User identification without PII content - tracks behavioral patterns, not sensitive data

## Technology Choices & Reasoning

### Frontend Stack
- **Next.js 15**: Server-side rendering for SEO, built-in API routes, excellent TypeScript support
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for large-scale application development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid UI development with consistent design system
- **Radix UI**: Accessible, unstyled components with keyboard navigation

### Backend & Database
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities, built-in authentication, and RLS
- **Next.js API Routes**: Serverless functions for scalable backend logic
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation for API security and data integrity

### AI & Content Generation
- **Anthropic Claude**: Advanced language model optimized for technical content
- **Structured Output**: JSON-LD schema generation for search engine optimization

### Analytics & Monitoring
- **PostHog**: Developer-friendly analytics with event tracking and user behavior insights
